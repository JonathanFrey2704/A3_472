To run our Naive Bayes Classifier, all that is needed is to run the main.py file.
We have two other files: output.py and textProcess.py. output.py has a method to generate output files and textProcess is to initialize the test data.

Here are specific instructions when running main.py:
-Uncomment line 56 to 64 to run our NB classifier with filtered vocabulary
-Uncomment line 138 to generate output file for original vocabulary 
-Uncomment line 140 to generate output files for filtered vocabulary
